## 🧠 Model Architecture

### Selected Model: DenseNet169

After extensive experimentation with multiple architectures, **DenseNet169** emerged as the optimal choice for skin lesion classification.

#### Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | Key Finding |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| EfficientNet-B0 | 67% | Underperformed on imbalanced data |
| EfficientNet-B4 | 68% | Moderate improvement over B0 |
| EfficientNet-B5 | 71% | Best among EfficientNet variants |
| **DenseNet169** | **90%+** | **Selected for production** ✓ |

#### Why DenseNet169?

- **Feature Reuse Architecture**: Dense connections enable efficient parameter utilization
- **High Accuracy**: State-of-the-art performance on skin lesion classification
- **Clinical Validation**: Proven effectiveness in multiple dermatology AI studies
- **Inference Efficiency**: Optimal balance between accuracy and computational speed
- **Robustness**: Performs well even with imbalanced medical datasets

## 📊 Dataset: HAM10000

**Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images**

- **Size**: 10,015 dermatoscopic images
- **Classes**: 7 diagnostic categories
- **Resolution**: 600×450 pixels (high-quality dermatoscopic)
- **Source**: Real-world clinical practice with histopathological confirmation

### Class Distribution

| Class | Full Name | Image Count | Prevalence |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| NV | Melanocytic Nevi | 6,705 | 67.0% |
| MEL | Melanoma | 1,113 | 11.1% |
| BKL | Benign Keratosis-like Lesions | 1,099 | 11.0% |
| BCC | Basal Cell Carcinoma | 514 | 5.1% |
| AKIEC | Actinic Keratoses | 327 | 3.3% |
| VASC | Vascular Lesions | 142 | 1.4% |
| DF | Dermatofibroma | 115 | 1.1% |

### Data Imbalance Challenge

- **Majority Class (NV)**: 67% of dataset
- **Minority Classes**: AKIEC, VASC, DF each <3.5%
- **Clinical Significance**: Rare classes (like melanoma) are medically critical

## ⚖️ Data Balancing Strategy

### Undersampling Method (Selected Approach)

```
Original Approach:
├── Challenge: Severe class imbalance (67% NV vs 1.1% DF)
├── Problem: Model biased toward majority class
└── Solution: Strategic undersampling of majority class

Implementation:
1. Reduced NV class representation to match clinical prevalence
2. Maintained all samples from minority classes
3. Applied weighted loss functions for remaining imbalance
4. Ensured sufficient representation of critical classes (MEL, BCC)
```

### Alternative Methods Tested

| Method | Accuracy | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| Class Weighting | 72% | Simple implementation | Limited improvement |
| Oversampling (SMOTE) | 75% | Preserves all data | Risk of overfitting |
| **Undersampling + Focal Loss** | **90%+** | **Best performance** | Reduced NV samples |
| Ensemble Methods | 82% | Good generalization | High computational cost |

## 🎓 Training Configuration

### 5-Fold Cross-Validation Protocol
